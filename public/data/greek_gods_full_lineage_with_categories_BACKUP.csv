Chaos,Gaea,Earth and fertility,Primordial,Neutral,"Mother Earth, the primordial goddess who birthed the sky, mountains, and sea. She is the ancestral mother of all life and the foundation of the cosmos.\n\nGaea played a pivotal role in multiple divine conflicts, orchestrating the overthrow of both Uranus and later Cronus when they proved tyrannical. She created the race of Giants to challenge the Olympians and continues to embody the living earth itself, feeling every footstep upon her surface and nurturing all growing things."
Chaos,Tartarus,The underworld,Primordial,Neutral,"The deep abyss beneath the underworld, serving as both a primordial deity and a prison for the Titans. Represents the darkest depths of existence.\n\nLocated as far below Hades as heaven is above earth, Tartarus is surrounded by three layers of night and bronze walls. It serves as the ultimate prison for divine beings who transgress against the cosmic order, where even the Titans languish in eternal darkness after their defeat in the Titanomachy."
Chaos,Eros,Love and attraction,Primordial,Neutral,"God of love and desire who shoots arrows to inflame passion. Though born from Chaos, also said to be Aphrodite's son, wielding irresistible power.\n\nAs one of the primordial forces, Eros represents the fundamental attraction that brings order from chaos, compelling elements to unite and create. His influence extends beyond romantic love to encompass all forms of cosmic union, making him essential to the very structure of existence and the continuation of all life."
Chaos,Erebus,Darkness,Primordial,Neutral,The primordial personification of deep darkness and shadow. He represents the darkness of the underworld and the space between earth and the underworld.\n\nErebus and his sister Nyx together embodied the primeval darkness before creation brought light to the cosmos. His mists fill the hollow places beneath the earth and shroud the paths to the underworld, creating the boundary between the living world and the realm of the dead.
Chaos,Nyx,Night,Primordial,Neutral,"The powerful primordial goddess of night, feared even by Zeus himself. She emerges each evening to cloak the world in darkness.\n\nNyx dwells in a cave at the edge of the cosmos, from which she spreads her dark veil across the sky each sunset. So formidable is her power that Zeus himself refrains from angering her, showing deference to this ancient goddess whose dominion predates the Olympian order and whose children include Death, Sleep, and the Fates."
