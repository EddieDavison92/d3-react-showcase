- Explain purpose of the library

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install Node.jsif you haven't already. 

You can download node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Node is a JavaScript runtime that is required to run the site locally.

#### 2. Install Git if you haven't already.

You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Git is a version control system that is required to clone the repository, track changes, and push changes to the repository.

#### 3. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EddieDavison92/d3-react-showcase.git
```


#### 4. Navigate to the root directory of the repository:

```sh
cd C:/path/to/d3-react-showcase
```

#### 5. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

npm will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

## Running the site locally

Navigate to the root directory of the repository and run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploying the site

All changes committed to the `main` branch are automatically deployed to Vercel, the hosting platform for this site. Updates become live within approximately 1 minute after the changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

In contrast, changes made to the `dev` branch are not automatically deployed. To ensure a controlled deployment process, follow these steps:

1. **Commit Changes to the `dev` Branch:** Make all your changes and feature developments in the `dev` branch.
   
2. **Create a Pull Request to the `main` Branch:** Once your changes in the `dev` branch are ready and tested, create a pull request to merge them into the `main` branch. This will trigger the deployment process.

By following this workflow, you can manage deployments efficiently and minimise the risk of introducing issues to the live site.
